# morphos-ai-quickstart-frontend
This repository contains all the code for the user interface (UI) of the Morphos AI Quickstart application. This includes all the visual elements users will interact with in their web browser, the different steps of the wizard, and the client-side logic. We'll be using Next.js (React framework) for this part.
